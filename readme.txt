Installed dependencies:
PyMongo (Python library for MongoDB)
NLTK (For tokenization and lemmatization)
Beautiful Soup (For parsing HTML pages)

In order to run the code, you will need to have MongoDB installed as a local service (mongodb://localhost:27017/)
for the index to be created and for the search functions to work without changing the code. 

A json file containing the produced index will be included, which can then be imported 
into MongoDB for use with the search and retrieve functionality without having to recreate the index first on a new machine.
